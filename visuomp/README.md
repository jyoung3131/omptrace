# OpenMP OMPT Event Tracing and Visualization

We use lttng tracing framework (http://lttng.org/) for tracing OpenMP runtime using lttng-ust library, and use eclipse-based tracecompass GUI (http://tracecompass.org/) for visualize the tracing results. 

 * It requires to use data-driven analysis of tracecompass to visualize the OpenMP tracing data (http://help.eclipse.org/).
 * Tracecompass developer and user guide (https://wiki.eclipse.org/Trace_Compass)
 * Research project from Polytechnique Montreal: http://hsdm.dorsal.polymtl.ca/
